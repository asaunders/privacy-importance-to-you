1) Testimonial by Adam Saunders, Canada:

"I have been concerned about private sector and government invasion of privacy for many years. In my graduate studies, I took a class on Information Privacy. In a class at law school, I collaborated with two student colleagues on a presentation about FreedomBox, an effort to make software for cheap home plug servers with simple end-user configurability. The goal of FreedomBox is to decentralize computer internetworking, and to obsolesce centralized (and privacy-invasive) social networking services.

Privacy has many different definitions. Until recently, I had yet to find one I found compelling - that didn't seem to have internal or external problems with its implied theory of privacy. Columbia University law professor Eben Moglen has offered such a definition. 

Moglen defines privacy as encompassing three components: secrecy, anonymity, and autonomy. By secrecy, Moglen means the ability for individuals to communicate amongst each other in private, assured that only the intended recipient of the communication receives the contents of the message. Anonymity means the ability for an individual to disseminate messages in public without disclosing her identity. In Moglen's view - and in my view as well - individual autonomy can only exist if individuals can enjoy both secrecy and anonymity defined as such. For Moglen, privacy is like an environmental issue: invading one individual's privacy reduces that of other individuals.

We can apply this logic to understanding the world's current privacy crisis. If powerful organizations can prevent the people from communicating in secret, and from anonymously disseminating information to the public, then the people do not have the freedom to discuss politics freely and thus do not have the freedom to challenge political power. This was evident to those who suffered through the Soviet Union. 

Today, it has become more difficult for individuals to guarantee the secrecy or anonymity of their communications than for those living through the Soviet Union. Centralized social networking services collect massive amounts of data on the minutiae of individual social and business life. Computers running proprietary software that cannot be audited for privacy-defeating backdoors are not only the norm, they are also status symbols. Advertising companies have saturated the Internet with tracking technology. It is essentially impossible for non-technical individuals to send email that cannot be intercepted by private organizations and state agents. And the NSA has put into place machinery that collects unimaginable amounts of personal information from the Internet for state monitoring; among other crimes, it has effectively destroyed the ability to read online in secret.

Privacy is important to me because a society without privacy is a society without autonomy. And without autonomy, there is neither freedom nor democracy."



2) Testimonial by Matt Katz, United States of America:
"The public life is a series of masks. People project what they want each other to see - and rightly so. We need certain norms to rely on for our lives to mesh well together. 

But private life is the more interesting one. In privacy I can feel free to take all of my masks off - or to experiment with new ones. I can discover who I want to be often by discovering who I don't want to be - and I can make mistakes. Far better that I experiment and make mistakes in private or within a close private circle than that I be forced to do all my learning in public.

I learned to be good by making mistakes - and I don't want to share all the ugly details with everyone. I am embarassed by some of it. I want that free space to grow better."



3) Testimonial by x, US:

"I spent a year of my life in jail because an ex-roommate's closet contained a pile of junk I hadn't gotten around to throwing out. That pile of junk contained a USB key of some minor capacity. I have no doubt that he didn't know it was there, had never accessed it, and had no idea of the contents. Because of an illegal warrantless search due to a completely unrelated issue, his room was searched and this item was found to contain illegal data. The search was never authorised by the constitution or any legitimate authority. I was held liable merely because I was the only one living there at the time Despite that the item in question was never in my constructive posession or control. Eventually the entire case was thrown out. My roommate was safe because "posession is 9/10 of the law" even though I had no posession of the item myself, I was closer and a valid target in their eyes for a separate issue."
